            In this game, you will be matched into a group of 4 people and you will play 10 rounds in this group. 
            <br><br>
            In each round, each person is given an endowment of 20 tokens and can choose how many of these tokens to keep for themselves and how many to contribute to a group account. At the end of the round, the tokens in the group account are doubled and then divided equally among the four group members. That is, each person receives a return of 0.5 for each token that is contributed by someone to the group account. 
            <br><br>
            Your payoff after each group member makes their contribution decision is:
            <br><br>
            Payoff = 20 - Own Contribution + 0.5 (Total Amount Contributed by All Group Members)
