        Your platform was {{ player.platform }}. Your opponent had a platform of {{player.opponent_platform}}. {% if group.winner == 'Tie'%} Since you had equal platforms, the election is a tie. Therefore, in order to determine a winner, each voter randomly chose a candidate. {% endif %} As a result, you recieved {{player.votes}} out of 7 votes, and your opponent recieved the remaining {{a}} votes. So, your total payoff is {{player.payoff}}.
