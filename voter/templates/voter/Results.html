        Your platform was {{ player.platform }}. Your opponent had a platform of {{player.opponent_platform}}. {% if group.winner == 'Tie'%} Since you had equal platforms, each voter randomly chose a candidate. {% endif %} As a result, you recieved {{player.votes}} out of 7 votes, and your opponent recieved the remaining {{a}} votes. So, your total payoff is {{player.payoff}}. The voter spread is visible below.

        {% if player.participant.vars.votes.0 == 'W' %}

        Voter 1, holding an ideal point of .1, voted for you.

        {% elif player.participant.vars.votes.0 == 'L' %}

        Voter 1, holding an ideal point of .1, voted for your opponent.

        {% elif player.participant.vars.votes.0 == 'TW' %}

        Voter 1, holding an ideal point of .1, voted for you after flipping a coin.

        {% elif player.participant.vars.votes.0 == 'TL' %}

        Voter 1, holding an ideal point of .1, voted for your opponent after flipping a coin.
