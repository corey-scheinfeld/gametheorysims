After selecting a random marble, you guessed that the jar was {% if player.choice == True %} blue. {% else %} red. {% endif %}
<br><br>
{% if subsession.round_number <= 5 %}

{% if group.group_decision == player.choice %} The majority of your group matched your guess. {% else %} However, the majority of your group guessed that the jar was {% if group.group_decision == True %} blue. {% else %} red. {% endif %} {% endif %}

{% else %}

{% if group.group_decision == player.choice %} The entirety of your group matched your guess. {% else %} However, at least one member of your group guessed that the jar was {% if group.group_decision == True %} blue. {% else %} red. {% endif %} {% endif %}

{% endif %}
<br><br>
 So, the group decision was submitted as {{ group.group_decision }}.
<br><br>
 {% if group.group_decision == group.jar_type %} Way to go! Your group succesfully guessed that the true color of the jar was {% if group.jar_type == True %} blue! {% else %} red! {% endif %} As a result, each of you will recieve a payoff of {{ player.payoff }} {% else %} Unfortunetly, the true color of the jar was {% if group.jar_type == True %} blue. {% else %} red. {% endif %} Each of you will therefore recieve a payoff of {{ player.payoff }}. Better luck next time! {% endif %}
