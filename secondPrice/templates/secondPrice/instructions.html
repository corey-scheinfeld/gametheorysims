            For this game, you will participate in a series of auctions in small groups. In each auction,
            you will bid on a fictitious item, which is of some random value to you. This value will be different
            for each participant. In each round, each group member will simultaneously write down
            a bid for the item. You will then compare your bid with the bids of your other group members. The
            person with the highest bid wins and earns the items personal value. However, they still need to pay a
            price for the item. The price the winner pays is equal to the second highest bid in the group.
            The winnerâ€™s payoff is equal to their personal item value minus this price. The payoff of those who do not
            win is zero.

            You will participate in three auctions and your value for the item will vary across auction rounds.
            <ul>
                <li>In the first round, your value is equal to the last two digits of your cellphone
                number. </li>
                <li>In the second round, your value is equal to your DOB (the day of the month).</li>
                <li>In the third round, your value is equal to the last two digits of your campus
                mailbox or street number.</li>
            </ul>
