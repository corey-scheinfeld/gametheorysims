          In this game, you will randomly be matched with another player in the class. You will
          only interact via the computer, and will not know who you have been matched with. You
          and your partner must each simultaneously choose to hunt for Stag or hunt for Rabbit.
          The choice of Rabbit is associated with a payoff of 60, regardless of what the other player does. If a player chooses Stag, then they get a payoff of 75 if the other person chose Stag also, and a payoff of 0 if the other person chose Rabbit. You will play for 5 rounds, with 5 different partners.
